The MapCreator application is a Windows 10/11 application for creating fantasy maps. It was based on the functionality of Wonderdraft, but is significantly different in many ways.

The MapCreator application was written in C# using Windows Forms and SkiaSharp (and some Windows GDI code) for creating and rendering maps and map objects.
